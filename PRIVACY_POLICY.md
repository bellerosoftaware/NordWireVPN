This Privacy Policy describes how NordWireVPN ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

### 5.2 Security Measures

## 6. Data Retention

- **Deletion**: Clear all app data through Android settings or uninstall the app
- **Modification**: Change your private key, preferences, and settings at any time
- **Export**: Configuration files can be exported and are yours to keep

## 8. Children's Privacy

This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
